# Case Study- CRED

 
## Product Strategy of CRED

 
- In this case study, let us look at CRED. The most recent Unicorn from India.

 
- The central purpose of the existence of a product is that it has to solve a real user need. CRED solved a real user pain point, which was to make Credit card payments easily.

 
- Credit card payment was always difficult in India — especially if you didn’t have a savings/current bank account with the provider. For example, if you banked with HDFC and used Standard Chartered only for Credit Card, then making card bill payments was a massive pain — requiring you to input card details, bill amount and payment details manually. Cred simplified it by doing all the hard work for you — all you needed to do was select bill amount and pay. It provided allied services like credit score, card statements etc. But those are not the primary use case.

 
- Cred truly simplified card payments. As part of user onboarding, the credit card details are collected and and before the due date, Cred automatically notifies users of pending dues and simplest payment in one place. Users no longer had to retype their card numbers and also didn’t have to remember the due dates.

 
- What made CRED stand apart was how the CRED product team approached the challenges around acquisition, activation and engagement.

 
- In order to acquire new users, CRED went with the product strategy of exclusivity.

 
- **Exclusivity (Create intrigue):** Cred is marketed as a members only app. And becoming a member gives you certain exclusive benefits. This exclusivity brings with it a sense of intrigue and premium feeling to the app. Over the years a similar strategy has been adopted by Gmail, Facebook to bring this sense of exclusivity and intrigue through invite only growth in the beginning. A note for caution though is that ‘Exclusivity’ as a strategy might not be ideal for every product- it has to tie into your larger business model. For Cred — they tied the exclusivity based on a users credit score. Anyone with a score of above 750 could enter. It is likely those with good credit scores are likely to be regular credit payers, it makes sense to restrict usage this way.

 
 
- **Gems (Referral reward):** Referral is also a common strategy used for increasing adoption across many products.

 - What Cred did here slightly differently was using game mechanics. Every referral got you ‘Gems’. You could see your gems grow and you can sell these gems for cool rewards.

 
- Post acquisition, the question was about activating the users. A user is activated in CRED when they make a credit card bill payment. In order to get users to make the payment, they were incentivized with cred rewards in the form of coins. So users made payments to get virtual coins.

 
- **Coins:** Every time someone uses the app to make payment — they earn cred coins. They could have made 1 Rupee = 1 Cred Coin. But to give a sense of higher earning, coins are awarded disproportionately higher than the amount you pay for.

- Once activation was done, it was about keeping the users engaged. Here too CRED product team came with the strategy of gamifying the experience to keep users engaged. Not only were users rewarded with points, the rewards were also variable. Sometimes you might get cashbacks, other times you might get vouchers and so on. So this gamified product helped increase engagement.

 
- **Variable Rewards through Games:** You could also play a game and win rewards. You can keep spending coins and buy slots and play games.

- So CRED is a very good case study to understand how product strategies can help increase acquisition, activation and engagement.
